* Simple Scala Web App

This web app queries the airports existing in a given country (e.g.
querying IT or Italy) and reports the top/bottom 10 countries for
number of airports. Also it reports the top 10 runways for their
presence in airports.

To use the app run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sbt run
#+END_SRC

and open your browser, for example with Firefox:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
firefox http://localhost:9000/query
#+END_SRC
